## Technical Details

### Parser Capabilities
The replayer parser extracts:
- All player actions with amounts
- Board cards by street
- Player stacks at each point
- Pot sizes after each action
- Winner and winning hand information

### Data Storage
- Hand texts are stored in memory when data is loaded
- Up to 50 most relevant hands shown in dropdown (for performance)
- All hands accessible through filtering

## Limitations

1. **Performance**: Limited to 50 hands in dropdown at once (use filters to narrow down)
2. **Card Visibility**: Only Hero's cards are visible (unless shown at showdown)
3. **Side Pots**: Complex side pot situations may not be fully represented
4. **Time Bank**: Player time-to-act information not currently available

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features:
- Auto-play mode with configurable speed
- Hand strength indicators
- Equity calculations at each decision point
- Bet sizing analysis overlays
- Player statistics display
- Hand history export from replayer
- Comparison mode (compare similar situations)

## Troubleshooting

**"Hand text not available for replay"**
- Reload your data using the "Load from Path" or "Upload Files" buttons
- The replayer needs access to raw hand history files

**Hands not appearing in dropdown**
- Check your filters - they may be too restrictive
- Try "All" for position and type filters
- Ensure data is loaded (check that other sections show hands)

**Actions seem incorrect**
- This may be a parsing issue with your specific hand format
- Please report the hand ID and site to help improve the parser
